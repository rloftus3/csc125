<td>PREORDER</td><td>displays the contents of entire tree across the screen as a table with two rows using a <i>preorder traversal</i>.  The first row contains the value and the second row contains the strings.  (You'll likely need separate routines to print each row)   </td>

<tr>
<td>PRINT</td><td><b>EXTRA CREDIT, OPTIONAL</b> displays the contents of entire tree so it look like the tree really looks.  You can limit yourself to 10 levels.  You might consider using the HTMLTable class you wrote earlier in the semester. Arrows aren't necessary, but are extra nice.  Sideways is ok too. </td>
